## Introduction

We use 12k Driven End Bearing Fault Data with rotation speed of 1797 rpm collected from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing data center. 

The data set contains 9 different fault conditions and 1 normal conditions.

The data set is divided into training set, validation set and test set with the ratio of 6:2:2. 

The data set is available at [Here](https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/download-data-file).
